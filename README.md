# AI-generated Conway's Game of Life (using Typescript)

## Prompt

"
I would like to create a React app that implements Conway's "Game of Life". We can start with a 50x50 grid for the game board, and there should be stop, start, and reset buttons. When stopped, clicking a cell should toggle it between alive and dead, and in the running state, cells should update according to the original rules of Conway's "Game of Life", every second, by default. There should be a slider that allows the update cycle to be sped up or slowed down.
"

I then followed up by running all recommended console commands and approving all changes.

## AI Work Summary

"
I've now created a complete implementation of Conway's Game of Life with React and TypeScript. The application includes:

1. A 50x50 grid where cells can be toggled between alive and dead states
2. Start, stop, and reset controls
3. A speed slider to adjust the simulation speed from 50ms to 2000ms
4. Clean, modern styling with CSS
5. Clear instructions for users

You can run the application using either:

1. Open a terminal and run npm run dev
2. Or use VS Code's task system by pressing Ctrl+Shift+B (or Cmd+Shift+B on macOS)

The application will start on http://localhost:5173 by default. When the application loads:

1. You can click cells to toggle them between alive and dead states while the simulation is stopped
2. Click the Start button to begin the simulation
3. Use the slider to adjust the speed of the simulation
4. Click Reset to clear the board and start over

## Adjustments

There was some text that was poorly contrasted against its background, so it was hard to read,
 and also the AI styles gave each cell a fade transition, which I felt made it harder to watch the runtime.

I adjusted these manually in the CSS files, since it was slightly quicker than typing into the prompt.

If I were using speech-to-text, I would have probably asked the AI to fix these stylistic imperfections.
